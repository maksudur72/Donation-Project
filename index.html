            <p>The floods in Bangladesh are thought to be the most severe in 100 years. More than a third of the country
                has been submerged. At least 115 people have died and more than 5.7 million are affected. The government
                and NGOs are struggling to cope with the extent of the disaster and warn of risk of disease as well as
                shortages of crucial supplies including food, medication and clean drinking water. More than half a
                million homes have been damaged.</p>
